```lrc
[00:02.16] It starts with sorry
[00:06.67] That's your foot in the door, one simple sorry
[00:12.59] Spoken straight from your core
[00:15.48] The path to forgiveness is a twisting trail of hearts
[00:22.12] But sorry is where it starts
[00:36.12] 
[00:28.82] Who could forgive a dirtbag like me?
[00:34.39] I don't deserve your amnesty
[00:40.48] Can't we just kill him?
[00:43.00] Shoot him and spill his blood?
[00:58.00] 
[00:47.30] That's an option you could choose
[00:49.96] Works for us
[00:51.33] But who hasn't been in his shoes?
[00:55.86] It starts with sorry (sorry)
[01:09.86] 
[01:00.62] Dig down deeper and say one sincere sorry
[01:04.85] I'm so sorry
[01:06.75] And your journey's underway
[01:09.38] It'll take time to cover your vast multitude of sins
[01:15.38] But sorry is where it begins
[01:20.66] It starts with sorry
